                                                THE CAR THAT GOT KILLED




In one of my dreams I was inside a building, and,’ there in the entrance hall a car was parked. All of a sudden the car started itself up headed towards the doorway and plunged into the river where it sank right down to the bottom. A couple of boys approached me and said, “ car got killed”.
