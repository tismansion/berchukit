THE BATH WITH THE HUGE PLUGHOLE





One day a man having a bath accidentally pulled the plug out. As a result he fell down the plughole together with the water and landed in the drains. Sewer maintenance men rowing their boat down the sewer spotted the man and told him to climb back up the pipe leading to the plughole. He did and returned to the bath in his house at 23 Sewer Drive, Muckington, Bristolshire.  

The bath with the plughole large enough to cause a human being to fall down the water pipe wasn’t the only mishap in his house for lurking in his bedroom was a ceiling with a huge gaping mouth and giant gnashers ready to pounce on any  person who happened to be in the room.
As it happened the mouth jumped down on the bed and tried to bite a chunk out of Terry Blowtorch, the owner of the house.
