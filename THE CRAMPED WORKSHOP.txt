Once upon a time there existed a workshop in which the computers were so tightly packed that there was no room to move all because of a mad boss called Kevin manure who ruled the workshop with a rod of iron. The wiring for the computers was frayed and could cause an electric shock. Not only that, there was virtually no room to move about as the room in which the computers were so tightly packed was only six feet wide, and with as many as 20 computers packed into a tiny space of only four feet wide it’s not surprising that people were struggling to breathe, and work was horrendous and hours were long – 20 hours each day to work on a computer plugged in with wires frayed and plugs half open.

If you wanted to go to toilet you could only go when work was over, no toileting during work hours. All the time the workers had to hold it up. It’s not surprising unwanted accidents happened and what a terrible stink this could create all because the mad boss wouldn’t allow any person to go to toilet. If he dared sneak off to the loo the boss’s henchmen would send vicious dogs after him. If he managed to go into the toilet someone would push a stink bomb under the toilet door that would flush him out.


One day the back cover fell off the monitor on one of the computers exposing dangerously high voltages yet the boss made him use it seeing what a pig he was and when the worker did compute he got such a nasty shock that he was thrown right across the room. He was lucky to be alive for the computer that burst open could have killed him. Now the time was set afoot to remove Kevin manure the mad tyrant boss from office. A couple of workers called the police and in a jiffy the boss was overthrown.
