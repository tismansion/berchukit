THE BOY WHO WENT TO SCHOOL BY BUS



Tommy Gun who lived in Seaview Road travelled every day  by bus to school.
He got the bus at 8.07  a.m .


At school  he went straight into class  and sat down with a teddy bear.


Mr Strange, the teacher, said:
"Listen boys, you will now do sums, 250 of them."
The boys did.
One boy, Robert fur  did his sums on another boy's head.


"Come here, Robert Fur, how dare you write on top of Peter Stowe's head.
For that you'll get the birch."


Robert fur got the birch  right across his mouth.


The teacher sent the boy out of class for writing on top of another boy's head.


The boy went out of his class and got out his penknife.
He slashed the wall.
Mr Tongue, the headmaster came along and said:
"Hey you, stop that at once."


The unruly boy got grabbed by the headmaster and taken to his office.


"Now, bend over!.


The boy got flogged  20 times.


"That will teach you not to vandalise this school my boy said the headmaster".


At 10.45am it was school break and the boys went out into the playground.
One of the boys got scragged and his legs spat upon.
the bullies then used him as a goalpost whilst they were playing football.
Everytime the ball hit him his legs screamed.


After break the boys went back to their classrooms.


A few boys did P.E in class.
Some boys put drawing pins on the chalkboard.


there was a teacher with a great big tongue sticking out of his mouth.
His name was Mr. Beer.


Mr Beer,a teacher who roared like a lion, was very, very, very, very strict.
On one occasion he turned one boy upside down and tied his legs.
Then he let a dog loose to bite the boy's trousers.
Another boy, Brian Neck was caught with a snake inside his desk.
He got eaten by his own teacher.
