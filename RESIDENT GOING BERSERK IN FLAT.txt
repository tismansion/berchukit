                                    RESIDENT GOING BERSERK IN FLAT




One night in Flat no. 23z a resident went off her rocker all because a man in the next door flat was filling up a jug of water from the tap, which was set at full blast, making it very, very loud, in fact, so loud that the person next door went berserk and started chucking things about. Next she came up to the loud water tap man’s flat burst down the door and punched the man in the face, all because he filled up his jug with water.
“You, You scum you woke me up with your noise, next time I’ll chuck you out of the window, it’s the scum farm you should be, not here.”
In a frantic attempt to escape the hooligan the frightened resident pressed the red button; this brought one of the ‘sleep in staff down and she phoned the police. They came and took the woman from flat 23z to the punishment farm.
In the end the resident, Derek Fridge, had to be re - housed for his own safety – at Goldmilk Lodge.
This support home contained an isolation block where from now on he would live. This section, cut off from the rest of the block of flats, was a safe area where no one could have a go at the resident. Here he could make as much noise as he liked for no one could get at him.
