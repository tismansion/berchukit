This is Southend pier, the longest pier in the world, and a pier which has had to endure infernos throughout its whole life, by which the most recent was by far the worst. The fire damaged the pier so badly that huge chunks fell into the sea.
In the onslaught the Southend Pier railway station disappeared as did the gift shop, a number of restaurants and the amusement arcade. Even the railway that carries the pier trains was affected for the last section fell into the sea when it was destroyed by fire.
There was one incident on the pier that occurred a little while ago.
A gang of yobs grabbed hold of the gents’ toilet and chucked it into the sea, leaving men and boys without a toilet, so they had to dive into the sea and find the toilet.  If it sank to the bottom of the sea they would then have make their own toilets. They would get hold of  a load of sand and make a sand toilet, but they would have to be as quickly as possible before children could collapse the sand toilet, exposing the man.
The top policeman, PC World was contacted and he and his men and women tracked down the yobs and put them into a yob cage in the nearby human zoo in Duckpond  Road,  Southend.
A new toilet was eventually built on Southend Pier, made of extra strong steel and sprayed with yob repellent.
