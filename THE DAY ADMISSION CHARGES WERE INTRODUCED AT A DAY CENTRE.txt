                                  THE DAY ADMISSION CHARGES WERE 
                                  INTRODUCED AT A DAY CENTRE





One day, at Cornfield Day Centre the manager Neil Bounty announced that, 
'as from tomorrow you'll all be paying £50 per day to come into the centre,
because we're so hard up that, 'if we don't get the money in we'll have to close".

Next day every man and woman had to pay £50 to enter the centre and £2 to use the loo, even in the centre. Because of this the only other choice was to hold it up until hometime unless you were desperate and in dire straits.

The new pay as you enter rules left everybody much poorer.

Anyone who used Cornfield day Centre for four days had to pay £200 each week. As a result they had to cut down on the amount of food they had to buy. The poorest had to go for three days without food at home, ending up having to eat out of bins. Not only that, sometimes they had no money left for shopping. This wasn't the only thing, even dinner money charges were very high, £30 for a three course meal. If you were late for dinner you even had to pay more.
Going to the toilet when dinner was about to be served meant that by holding everybody up you were liable to be charged as much as £45 for a meal depending on how late you were for lunch. There were even plans to introduce  a charge for saying the prayers, about £1.00, and £3.00 for drinking a glass of water. 
disgusted at what was going on in the centre one man, Gordon Riot, decided to take the law into his own hands, for this he got suspended from the centre. hearing about this what Gordon Riot had done the home where he lived Youngmans Lodge decided to put him into care where the harshest punishments would be carried out, being deprived of food for a week and sent to prison for swearing at the staff. There were even plans to section Gordon Riot at Chopwood mental hospital.
