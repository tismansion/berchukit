                                                THE BOY WHO CLIMBED INTO A TOILET BOWL 







A boy who decided to have a swim whilst he was in the toilet climbed into the toilet bowl, but, 
"how could he get right down to the bottom? 
The answer: 
pull the flush. 
He did just that and flushed himself down the toilet, landing in the S bend. From here one of the toilet pipes led to an underground swimming pool.  
This is the first time that a person was able to enter a swimming pool through a toilet.
The swimming pool turned out to be the drains beneath the toilet.
‘Luckily the boy was slim otherwise he would have been stuck in the S bend, he then went along the drains and climbed into a pipe which led up into another toilet, this time in another person’s house. It only came to notice when a man sitting on the toilet saw a boy pop out of the toilet from underneath. The man got such a shock that his head fell off. The man picked up his head and put it back onto his body. He got hold of the boy who entered his house through the toilet and used him as a toilet brush.
“That’ll teach you not to enter my house through my toilet.”
‘The boy who entered the house through the loo got chucked into a dustbin. ‘But, no sooner than he got put in the bin he jumped out and chucked a tree at the house’s owner. He responded by grabbing hold of the boy and breaking him up. This did the trick, but, not for long for the boy put himself together again and flew away, diving under the earth and never seen again.
