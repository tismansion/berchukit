One day a new form of door to door transport was born – “Fail – A – Ride”, so – called because it failed to pick up anyone at their door yet it was licensed to exist by law. It was a derivative of “Failure Transport”, a major bus company whose job was to make sure that none of its buses picked up anyone at the bus stops.

People who ordered “Fail – A – Ride” to take them to their day centres were often told that their buses would never pick them up although they were licensed to do so. There were other forms of community transport, such as the Piggy Back. A man came and gave people a piggy back to take them all the way to the centre.
