Not only that, he was also made to clean out the toilet, using his head as a toilet brush. He put his head into the toilet bowl and used it to clean out the toilet bowl with. because he had shirts hung up on his nose the shirts went into the toilet bowl with him whilst he was cleaning it out with his head. he also had to hoover the ceiling and sweep the floor with his head.

For drying up the dishes he had to use hair from his head.
One day he was warned that if he refused to work his master would suck him up into the vacuum cleaner and make him eat dirt. not only that his bed would be chucked out of the window and put into a skip.
