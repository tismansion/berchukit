                  STORY OF THE SCHOOL TEACHER WHO HAD A BLACKBOARD ON HIS CHEST







Fred Cereal, a 20 foot tall school teacher, had a blackboard on his chest.      
In his class there were a total of 500 children.
The class had windows stuffed with dinner plates, and every school desk had wheels on it.
The desks of cause had dogs inside them.
Every time a child opened his desk a dog jumped out and knocked him flying.
 
One day the headmaster, Mr. Chops, held a conversation with Fred Cereal on how to run the school.
The headmaster said that all boys should lick the playground every morning the report to me at 9.00am, then they get the cane and off they go to their classes.
By tradition every boy got the cane to make them ready for class in this school, Sugarbush comprehensive.
Another tradition was that every boy should comb his teeth and take his trousers off in class,
'that's the school uniform.
 
At lessons every boy at this school did his sums on a loaf of bread and drank ink to prevent him daydreaming in class.
 
One day a boy dumped sugar down the toilet.
Mr Dirty, the P.E instructor,caught him and told him to eat cement.
After he ate cement the boy Michael O got the birch across his head.
In fact he got birched so hard that his head flew off and stuck to the window.
the head danced on the window then flew back onto its owner, the boy himself.
 
Mr Chops, the headmaster, at Sugarbush school,was very strict.
he once gave the boys the birch for throwing darts at the sun.
