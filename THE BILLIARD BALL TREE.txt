

THE BILLIARD BALL TREE



Once there was a tree that grew billiard balls in Goodfood Park.
It was a good idea because it saved buying billiard balls.
Before the balls could be used they had to ripen, but, ‘beware, a bird could very easily hatch out of the billiard ball or the ball could spit poison at you. Worst of luck the billiard ball could bite and that bite, and that bite could be poisonous. It could even kill, and, ‘ if it does then the man who planted the billiard ball tree could be charged with murder.

As it was in a park lawn billiards was the main game, that is, ‘a game of billiards without the table.
There were other games as well, such as, ‘duck pond football.
You had to climb into the duck pond and play football, surrounded by ducks all the time, but you ran the risk of a rogue duck pecking the football. To prevent this, the only way was to spray duck repellent on the football.
